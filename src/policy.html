        Introduction
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Ivan Pigevisch develops and publishes social games for the web and mobile
        devices (the “Service”). We may refer to Ivan Pigevisch as "we" or "us".
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Ivan Pigevisch is committed to protecting the privacy of its users and
        provide them a better social gaming experience ("users" or "you"). This
        Privacy Policy has been created to inform you about how Ivan Pigevisch
        manages, collects, stores, shares, uses and protects the information you
        provide in connection with any Ivan Pigevisch game or application whenever
        you play our games or otherwise access any of our Services, products,
        content and/or the other domains provided by Ivan Pigevisch.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        This Privacy Policy applies whenever you play our games or otherwise access
        any of our other products, services, content and/or the other domains
        provided by Ivan Pigevisch, together referred to as “Services.” This
        Privacy Policy describes:
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        1. what information we collect, how we collect it
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        2. how we use that information and with whom we share it
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        3. how you can access and update that information and means of
        communications
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        4. how do we protect children privacy
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        5. how we protect the information we store and share about you
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        By using the Service, you agree to the collection, disclosure, storage and
        use of your information as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you do not
        want Ivan Pigevisch to collect, store, use or share your information in the
        ways described in this Privacy Policy, you should not play Ivan Pigevisch’s
        games or use our Services. Ivan Pigevisch may amend the Privacy Policy from
        time to time, and Ivan Pigevisch encourages you to consult the Privacy
        Policy regularly for changes.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct
        marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure,
        typically by "opting in" to receive information from a third party that is
        participating in a sweepstakes or other promotion on one of our sites. If
        you do ask us to share your personal information with a third party for its
        marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that
        specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party
        (other than our service providers) on a continual basis.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct
        marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide
        personal information on one of our sites.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Users in certain jurisdictions have a right to access personal information
        held about themselves. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance
        with applicable law.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        1. Information We Collect and How We Collect It
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Ivan Pigevisch only collects Personal Information to the extent necessary
        to fulfil one or more of its functions and activities, and will do so only
        by fair and reasonable means. Generally we will collect Personal
        Information directly from the individual to whom the Personal Information
        relates, but in some circumstances (including as outlined below), it may be
        necessary for us to collect information from a third party source.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        1. Information About You That We Get from Third-Party Applications,
        Including Social Networks (like Vkontakte)
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        If you play Ivan Pigevisch’s games or access any of our other Services on
        connected third-party applications or connect our Services to any
        third-party applications, including social networks like Vkontakte, Ivan
        Pigevisch may receive certain information about you from the provider of
        the third-party application. The information we receive depends on the Ivan
        Pigevisch game you’re playing, the third-party application, your privacy
        settings and, if applicable, your friends’ privacy settings on that
        third-party application.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        For example, Ivan Pigevisch may collect and store some or all of the
        following information shared by the provider of the connected third-party
        application:
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your first and last name;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your profile picture or its URL;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your user ID number (like your Vkontakte ID number), which may be linked
        to publicly-available information like your name and profile photo;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • the user ID number and other public data of your friends;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • the login e-mail you provided to that third-party application when you
        registered with it;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your physical location and that of the devices you use to access our
        Services;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your gender;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your birthday and/or age range;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • information about your activities on or through the connected third-party
        application;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • other publicly-available information on the third-party application;
        and/or
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • any other information that you or the provider of the third-party
        application share with Ivan Pigevisch.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        If you are unclear about what information a third-party application is
        sharing with us, please go to the third-party application to find out more
        about their privacy practices.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        2. Cookies and Automated Information Collection
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Like many websites, Ivan Pigevisch and service providers acting on our
        behalf, like Google Analytics, store log files and use tracking
        technologies such as "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small
        data file that is transferred to your computer’s hard disk or your mobile
        device for record-keeping purposes. The Service may send cookies to a
        computer or a mobile device when a user accesses or views a Service.
        Information contained in a cookie may be linked to personal information for
        purposes such as improving the quality of Ivan Pigevisch’s Service,
        tailoring recommendations to interests, and making the Service easier to
        use.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Third party advertisers on the Services may also use, place or read cookies
        or other technologies as described below on your browser, and those
        practices are subject to their own policies. Cookies can be disabled at any
        time by changing your web browser’s options to stop accepting cookies, to
        prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit or limit
        the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate differently than
        browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a web browser may
        not remove flash cookies. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may
        not be able to use all features, portions or functionalities of the
        Service.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        We and our service providers may also employ other technologies including
        (i) web beacons, which allow us to know if a certain page was visited or
        whether an e-mail was opened; (ii) tracking pixels, which allow us or our
        advertising partners to advertise more efficiently and effectively by
        excluding our current users from certain promotional messages, identifying
        the source of a new installation or delivering ads to you on other
        websites; and (iii) local shared objects also known as flash cookies, which
        help us to reduce fraud, remember your in-game preferences and speed up
        load times.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        We and our service providers use these log files, tags, and tracking
        technologies to collect and analyze certain kinds of technical information,
        including:
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • the type of device you are using;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your operating system version;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your mobile device’s identifiers, like your MAC Address, Identifier For
        Advertising (IDFA), and/or International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI);
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your browser types;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your browser language;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • referring and exit pages, and URLs;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • platform type;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • the number of clicks on a page or feature;

      <p dir="ltr">
        • domain names;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • landing pages;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">

        • the amount of time spent on particular pages; and

        • game state and the date and time of activity on our websites or games.

      <p dir="ltr">
        In some cases, we will connect this information with your social network ID
        or Ivan Pigevisch user ID.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        For more information on how to limit the types of cookies you allow, please
        see Opting out of Cookie Tracking section.

      <p dir="ltr">
        3. Information About You That You Share With Us Directly
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        When you use our Services (whether through a social network or through Ivan
        Pigevisch directly), you may give us information directly (like when you’re
        setting up your account) and we will store that on our systems and use it
        for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Some games or parts of our Services may use a more traditional registration
        or account set-up process where you may be asked to give us some or all of
        the following information:
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your age or birthday;
      </p>

        • your first and last names;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your e-mail address;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • a password;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • other information that helps us make sure it’s you accessing your account
        or helps us improve our services (such as answers to an online survey or a
        feedback form).
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        We may also let you create a player profile, separate from your social
        networking site profile (for example, your Vkontakte profile), that other
        Ivan Pigevisch players can see. Your player profile may include information
        like:
      </p>

        • a profile photo;

        2. How We Use the Information We Collect and With Whom We Share It
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        1. How We Use Your Information
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        The main use of the information we collect and store is to provide a better
        gaming experience, but there are other uses as well. The uses for which we
        collect and store your information include:
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • to create your game accounts and allow you to play our games;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • to operate, improve and optimize our Services and our players’
        experiences;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • to identify and suggest connections with other Ivan Pigevisch players and
        personalize our Services to you;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • to enable players to communicate with each other;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • to provide technical support and respond to player inquiries;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • to protect the safety and well-being of our players;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • to protect Ivan Pigevisch's rights and property in connection with our
        Services;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • to manage and deliver contextual and behavioral advertising;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • to notify players of in-game updates, new products or promotional offers;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • to administer rewards, surveys, sweepstakes, contests, or other
        promotional activities or events sponsored or managed by us or our business
        partners;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • to comply with our legal obligations, resolve any disputes we may have
        with you or other players, and to enforce our agreements with third
        parties; and
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • to conduct research.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        One important use of your information is communication. If you have
        provided your e-mail address to Ivan Pigevisch, we will use it to respond
        to Customer Support inquiries, and keep you informed of your in-game
        activity, including comments from friends, let you know about in-game
        status and promotions as well as tell you about gift and neighbor requests.
        Some messages, like invites for friends to join you in a game, may include
        your name and profile photo. We may also send promotional e-mail messages
        and promotional SMS messages (e.g. text messages) ("Promotional
        Communications") directly or in partnership with other parties, in
        accordance with your marketing preferences. Each Promotional Communication
        will offer you choices about receiving additional messages. Receipt of such
        communications depends on Ivan Pigevisch having certain contact information
        from you. If you play one of our games designed for children under 13, you
        will not be able to provide us with certain contact information. Please see
        the section on Our Policies Concerning Children for more information.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        2. How We Share Your Information
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        We may disclose or publish aggregated information (information about you
        and other players collectively that is not intended to specifically
        identify you, for example, players between the ages of 25 and 30 who live
        Chicago) and other non-personal information about our players for industry
        analysis, demographic profiling, marketing, analytics, advertising, and
        other business purposes.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        In addition, we may share your information (which may include personal
        information) with third parties (in other words, parties other than Ivan
        Pigevisch) or allow third parties to collect this information from our
        Services in the following circumstances:
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        3. Your Consent
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        With your consent, we may share your information with third parties or
        allow them to collect your information from our Services in some ways not
        specifically described in this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        4. Aggregated and Analytical Information
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        We use anonymous, statistical or aggregated information and may share it
        with our partners for legitimate business purposes. It has no effect on
        your privacy, because there is no reasonable way to extract data from the
        aggregated information that can be associated with you. We will share your
        identifiable information only subject to the terms of this policy, or
        subject to your prior consent.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        5. Friends and Other Ivan Pigevisch Players
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        The Service supports and often encourages you to interact with other
        players. In most Ivan Pigevisch games, if you play through a social network
        or register through a social network (for example, Vkontakte Connect), your
        social network friends will see your name, profile photo and descriptions
        of your game activity. Similarly, in many Ivan Pigevisch games, other
        players, regardless of whether they are your social network friends or not,
        will be able to see descriptions of your game activity (including the
        identification of any Ivan Pigevisch games you have played), communicate
        with you within our Services, and view your game profile, which may include
        your name or a “game name” and your profile photo. For example, in Ivan
        Pigevisch Poker, any other player may see your game profile if you are
        playing at the same table. In certain cases, your profile photo can reveal
        your social network ID or Ivan Pigevisch player ID, and access to a social
        network ID or Ivan Pigevisch player ID may allow others to view the public
        information associated with your related social network profile or Ivan
        Pigevisch account. Other players may also be able to send you game requests
        or even friend requests through the related social network’s or Ivan
        Pigevisch’s communication channels.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        6. Third-Party Advertising Including Tailored Advertising and Analytics
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        We have advertising on our Services so we can continue to offer many of our
        Services for free.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        We do not actively share personal information with third-party advertisers
        for their direct marketing purposes unless you give us your consent.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        When advertisers or ad networks place ads in our Services, they may collect
        or we may share the following types of information from within our
        Services:
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • performance data (like the number of clicks on an advertisement);
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • aggregated and/or de-identified information about you and other players
        collectively that is not intended to specifically identify you (like
        players between the ages of 21 and 25 who live San Francisco);
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • certain technical information (for example, IP addresses, non-persistent
        device identifiers such as IDFAs, and de-identified persistent device
        identifiers such as a hashed Android ID);
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • your social network ID;
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • and other contextual data about your game play (for example, your level
        and session length).
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        The information collected may be used to:
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • measure how effective ads are, to offer you targeted advertising in order
        to personalize your experience by showing you advertisements for products
        and services that are more likely to appeal to you (a practice known as
        behavioral advertising), and/or
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        • undertake web analytics (like Google Analytics which is used to analyze
        traffic and other player activity to improve your experience).
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Advertisers or ad networks may collect this information through the use of
        tracking technologies like browser cookies and web beacons, and they may
        use a single tracking technology or multiple tracking technologies at the
        same time.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Please note, after clicking on a third party advertisement, you may no
        longer be on a site hosted by Ivan Pigevisch or the social network through
        which you are playing Ivan Pigevisch’s games.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        If you do not want to receive tailored in-application advertisements from
        third parties, please see How to Access, Update and Manage Your
        Information. Please note that no tailored advertisements will be delivered
        for Ivan Pigevisch games designed for children under 13, though Ivan
        Pigevisch may allow contextual advertisements to be displayed.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        7. Third-Party Service Providers
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        We will share your information with third-party companies to perform
        services on our behalf, like processing payments, analyzing data,
        optimizing game play, e-mail delivery, hosting services, customer service
        and to help us in our marketing efforts, including managing and delivering
        contextual and tailored advertisements. We contractually require these
        third-party service providers to maintain the confidentiality of the
        information we share with them, and we contractually require them not use
        your information for anything other than to provide services on our behalf.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        8. Sale or Merger
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        In the event that Ivan Pigevisch undergoes a business transition (including
        proposed transactions), like a merger, acquisition by another company, or
        sale of all or part its assets (like selling a game), we may disclose or
        transfer all of your information, including personal information, to the
        successor organization in the transition. We will make reasonable efforts
        to let you and other players know (in the way described in Changes to Our
        Privacy Policy) of the business transition before transferring your
        personal information.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        9. Social Networking Sites:
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        If you access a Casino Deluxe Offering via a third party social networking
        site (a "Social Game"), Casino Deluxe may receive information about your
        social networking site profile, including without limitation the
        information you make publicly available, your social networking site user
        ID, your first, last and user names, profile and cover photos. If you
        invite new members into your Social Games network or send messages through
        Social Games, we may collect the information associated with those
        messages, including your friends' social networking site user IDs, email
        addresses and content.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        10. Linking with Social Networks:
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        If you access a Social Game, we may use your social networking site profile
        ID to link your social networking site account with your activities within
        the Social Game or offer personalized Casino Deluxe advertisements on the
        social networking site. We may use your social networking site first, last
        and user names and icon to identify you to the social networking site
        account you've linked to your activities within the Social Game, as well as
        for the purposes of rankings, competitions, sweepstakes, game high scores
        and/or identification to your social network.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        If you access a Social Game and provide us with another person's contact
        information for purposes of delivering information through a Social Game,
        we may use this information to contact and, if necessary, remind that
        person that she or he has been invited to join a Social Game or received
        content through a Social Game. All invitees are provided with the option
        not to receive further invitations from Casino Deluxe.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        3. How to Access, Update and Manage Your Information and Means of
        Communication
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        1. Accessing and Updating Your Information Held by Ivan Pigevisch
      </p>

        "Delete My Account" in the subject line and include your first name, last
        name, e-mail address and your social network ID for the social network from
        which you access our Services (if applicable) in the body of the e-mail
        (for example, your Vkontakte user ID). We will respond to your request
        within thirty days. Please note that certain records, for example those
        relating to payments or customer service matters, will be held for legal
        and accounting purposes. If you have sent content through or posted content
        on the Service, we may not be able to delete it.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        3. Manage Information We get from a Third-Party Application
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        To manage the information Ivan Pigevisch receives about you from a
        third-party application where you play our games, like Vkontakte, you will
        need to follow the instructions for the third-party application for
        updating your information and changing your privacy settings. To review and
        update information associated with your Ivan Pigevisch game profile in
        certain games, visit the “settings” page in that game. You also can manage
        some aspects of information collection and use by visiting the “settings”
        page of your mobile device and reviewing the permissions of each
        application or “app.”
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Once Ivan Pigevisch receives your information from a third-party
        application or your mobile device, that information is stored and used by
        Ivan Pigevisch in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You may access and
        update that information as described below.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        4. Opting Out of Geolocation
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        If you have previously allowed us to access your geolocation data, you can
        stop making geolocation available to us by visiting your mobile device's
        settings for the relevant application or the “settings” page for the
        relevant game.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        5. Opting Out of Promotional Emails from Ivan Pigevisch
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        If you want to stop receiving promotional e-mails from Ivan Pigevisch,
        click on the "unsubscribe" link in any promotional email from Ivan
        Pigevisch or visit the e-mail preference . Please note that once we receive
        your request, it may take an additional period of time for your opt-out to
        become effective. Your unsubscribe or e-mail preference change will be
        processed promptly, and in no event longer than ten business days.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        6. Opting from FB messages
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        If you want to stop receiving messages through our game pages, you may
        click on the “settings” icon on the top of such message, and by clicking
        ”manage messages” you may turn off all messages from such game.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        7. Opting Out of Other Communications
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        When you install our apps on your mobile device you can choose to receive
        push notifications, which are messages an app sends you on your mobile
        device even when the app is not on. You can turn off notifications by
        visiting your mobile device’s “settings” page.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        In most of our games, you may find under “your account” or Settings”
        section an option to stop e-mail or other notifications.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        8. Opting Out of Third-Party Tailored Advertising
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        These opt-out tools are provided by third parties, not Ivan Pigevisch. Ivan
        Pigevisch does not control or operate these tools or the choices that
        advertisers and others provide through these tools.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        In addition, if you do not want to receive tailored in-application
        advertisements from third parties that relate to your interests in apps on
        your mobile device, you may opt- out by adjusting the ad tracking settings
        on your device. You can also reset the “Advertising Identifier” (like an
        IDFA) from your mobile device’s settings page, which will prevent continued
        use of existing behavioral data tied to the previous “Advertising
        Identifier.” Further, depending on the platform provider (such as Apple or
        Google), you may be able to download apps, such as the Digital Advertising
        Alliance’s “AppChoices” app, that offer to provide you with control
        regarding the collection and use of cross-app data for tailored
        advertising. Like the opt-out tools mentioned above for web, these mobile
        opt-out tools are provided by third parties, not Ivan Pigevisch. Ivan
        Pigevisch does not control or operate these tools or the choices that
        advertisers and others provide through these tools.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Please note that you may still receive advertisements from third parties
        within Ivan Pigevisch’s games even if you opt out of tailored advertising
        but they will not be based on your activity across unrelated web sites or
        apps.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        9. Opting Out of Cookie Tracking
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        You can set your web browser to warn you about attempts to place cookies on
        your computer or limit the type of cookies you allow. Flash cookies operate
        differently than browser cookies and cookie management tools available in a
        web browser may not remove flash cookies. To learn more about and manage
        flash cookies you can visit the Adobe website and make changes at the
        Global Privacy Settings Panel.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        If you disable cookies, you may lose some of the features and functionality
        of our Services because Ivan Pigevisch cookies are necessary to track and
        enhance your game activities.

        10. California Online Privacy Protection Act Notice
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        At this time, there is no general agreement on how companies like Ivan
        Pigevisch should interpret Do Not Track signals. Ivan Pigevisch does not
        currently respond to Do Not Track signals, whether that signal is received
        on a computer or on a mobile device. You can learn more about Do Not Track.

        4. Children Policy
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        1. Policy Regarding Persons Under 21
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Unless written otherwise, our games are intended for use by those 21 or
        older for amusement purposes only. Without derogating from the foregoing,
        Ivan Pigevisch does not knowingly collect personal information from
        children under the age of 18. Children under the age of 18 should not use
        our websites or games at any time. If Ivan Pigevisch learns that a person
        under the age of 18 has provided it with personal information, Ivan
        Pigevisch will take reasonable steps to delete such information as soon as
        possible.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        5. How we protect the information we store and share about you.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        1. Security of Your Information
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Ivan Pigevisch has made reasonable technical and organizational measures
        designed to secure your information both online and offline from accidental
        loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure, and we
        are committed to the protection of customer information. We will take
        reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        When you sign into your Ivan Pigevisch account or enter payment
        information, we or our third-party payment processor use secure socket
        layer technology ("SSL") to encrypt the transmission of that information.
        While we take reasonable precautions against possible security breaches of
        our Services and our customer databases and records, no website or Internet
        transmission is completely secure, and Ivan Pigevisch cannot guarantee that
        unauthorized access, hacking, data loss, or other breaches will never occur
        and that third parties will never be able to overcome those measures or use
        your personal information for improper purposes.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Also please note that email and messaging systems are not considered
        secure, so Ivan Pigevisch discourages you from sending Ivan Pigevisch
        personal information through these media. We urge you to take steps to keep
        your personal information safe (including your account password), and to
        log out of your account after use. If you access our Services through a
        social network and your social network account is hacked, this may lead to
        unauthorized play of your Ivan Pigevisch games without your permission. So,
        be careful to keep your Account Information secure.
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr">
        Although we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the

        that laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and so the privacy laws
        applicable to the places where your information is transferred to or
        stored, used or processed in, may be different from the privacy laws
        applicable to the place where you are resident.

        necessary for our business purposes or for legal requirements. For
        instance, we may retain some information for a few years after you have
